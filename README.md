# ESG Analysis in S&P500 Companies

This repository contains the final project for the UBC course ECON323 - Quantitative Economic Modelling with Data Science Applications

In this project, we delve into the intricate relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics and financial performance among companies in the S&P 500. Given the heightened focus on sustainability and corporate responsibility, we aim to discern if companies with robust ESG profiles demonstrate superior financial metrics. Our investigation will encompass an index-wide analysis as well as sector-specific examinations.
